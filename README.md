## My process

I started with writing the html layout. The basic structure consists of a `<main>` element that serves the role of a container with 2 children elements - the qr code `<img>` element and a `<div .text>` containing all the text.

Then I started with the css. First, I centered the `<main>` using flexbox on the `<body>` and gave the container a fixed size. Then I went on to arranging the elements inside the container and for that I used flexbox too. I gave the `<img>` `width: 100%;` to fit the size of the container and the `.text` some margins and styling.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Basic Flexbox
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned how to use basic flexbox proprieties and how to arrange elements inside a container using flexbox, paddings and margins. Also, I learned how to use [frontendmentor.com](frontendmentor.com), which has been a very interesting experience, and learn how to use Git and GitHub, which I haven't used before.

### Continued development

For my next projects, I will focus more on:

- Mastering basic css, flexbox and grid
- Getting more familiar with Git
- Writing more readable code
